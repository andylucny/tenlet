# tenlet
opposite to telnet

When you like to test communication between TCP server nad client launch server as:

$ tenlet 4444

and then client, e.g. 

$ telnet 192.168.1.2 4444

and chat.

While telnet is a standard utility, its opposite is usually missing, so this is a solution.
Both for Linux and MS Windows.
